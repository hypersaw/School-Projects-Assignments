Project 5 (Final) for CS340 (Software Design)

SECTIONS:
  I.  KNOWN ISSUES
  II. HOW TO RUN

I) KNOWN ISSUES:
  1.  The player cannot manually set their board. This is by choice though, not an issue (well, the TA
      had an issue with it at least). Towards the end of the project I remembered I had been using a static board for testing
      and when it came down to it I pulled a Steve Jobs and said "you know what? The user doesn't need to arrange the board."
      An algorithm that places the pieces for me is just as arbitrary as my own personal opinion as to where the 
      piece(s) should go. Also saves time, both players are ready instantly! But I digress. Personal choice.
  2.  If the client quits midgame then the server instance will crash. Apparently the TA didn't catch this.

II) HOW TO RUN:
  1.  Open up Battleship Qt project file. 
  2.  Click run.
  3.  Click run again to open a second instance.
  4.  The program will display a prompt asking if you are hosting the match, select yes on one instance and no on the other
  5.  The server instance will load and show you the game board, and the client instance will ask for a port number. Within the server instance's output window a port number will be given, type this into the client's prompt.
  6.  Click 'Ready' on the client's side to begin the game. Server attacks first.
