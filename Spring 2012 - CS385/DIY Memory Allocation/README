Homework Assignment 7 for CS385 (Operating System Concepts and Design)

KNOWN ISSUES:
The program runs into a segfault running the final test. Initially I was given a 3/10 on the assignment, but after
reviewing the results with the course TA we found that something wasn't going right with the test scripts that caused
this error.

Received a 10/10.
