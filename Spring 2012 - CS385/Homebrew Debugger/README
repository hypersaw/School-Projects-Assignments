Homework Assignment 8 for CS385 (Operating System Concepts and Design)

KNOWN ISSUES:
When running the test scripts, test5 will always fail despite printing the correct output. This
was reviewed with the course TA and verified that the solution is in fact correct (new test scripts had
been handed out last minute and came with some issues, like this one).

Received a 23/15.
